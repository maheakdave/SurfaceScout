# Welcome to the Rover pathfinding project.

To get started setup a python virtual environment using -> `venv .env` in the console.

Install python dependencies by running -> `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run the api server using -> `python api.py` and then run the streamlit app by running -> `python -m streamlit run stapp.py`.

Below are few screenshots of the app.
